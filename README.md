(3)fcc_efficiency_and_Mann_after_mass_cut_for_paper.tex <br />
After selecting with Prof.Ashutosh, we chose 0.5GeV cut (exclude cluster and 0.25GeV) for summary, both for ROC curves and MannWhitney test.<br />
(a)For the histograms, because we want to include 99% signal, we just choose the range that includes them.<br />
(b)For analysis, we use the median bin from signal, and fix at that bin **Right side** to be the central, and change the bin width to plot the ROC curves.<br />
