The main parts are as following:
#========================================================================================#<br />
(1)fcc_hcal.tex<br />
This is the file for summary for all topics, including:<br />
(a)fcc_jets.tex (b)fcc_efficiency_and_Mann_after_mass_cut_for_paper.tex (c)fcc_Mass_soft_drop_for_paper.tex<br />

#===========================================================================================================#

(2)fcc_jets.tex<br />
This part is from Dr.Sergei.<br />

#===========================================================================================================#

(3)fcc_efficiency_and_Mann_after_mass_cut_for_paper.tex <br />
After selecting with Prof.Ashutosh, we chose 0.5GeV cut (exclude cluster and 0.25GeV) for summary, both for ROC curves and MannWhitney test.<br />
(a)For the histograms, because we want to include 99% signal, we just choose the range that includes them.<br />
(b)For analysis, we use the median bin from signal, and fix at that bin to be the central, and change the bin to plot the ROC curves.<br />
