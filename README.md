### [fcc_Mass_soft_drop_for_paper_new_no_UOF.tex](https://github.com/chihyeh/Paper-Writing/blob/master/fcc_Mass_soft_drop_for_paper_new_no_UOF.tex)
#### This part includes soft drop mass at beta=0 and beta=2 

<ul>
<li>Histograms
<ul>
<li>All histograms include underflow and overflow numbers in the bin 1 and the last bin.</li>
<li>We choose <strong>CLUSTER</strong> to do the analysis and the histograms.</li>
<li>Now we put all Figures in the paper, and we will select some of them to be the representations, removing others later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Analysis
<ul>
<li>We use the <strong>MEDIAN BIN</strong> from signal, and fix at that bin <strong>RIGHT SIDE</strong> to be the central value, and change the width to plot the ROC curves</li>
<li>We symmetrically add the bins from the central value , right and left from the central value, every time we add two bins, and totally add 14 bins to be our width in the end.
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

For summary:
<ol>
<li>We can conclude that in soft drop method, beta=0 can separate signal and background <strong>PERFECTLY up to 20 TeV center-of-mass energy</strong> in the smallest detector cell size. Bigger than that, both of tt and ww can't be distinguished from qq by smallest detector cell size perfectly.</li>
<li>In beta=2, there are <strong>NO IMPROVEMENT</strong> in all center-of-mass energies when detector cell size is smallest.</li>
</ol>

#### This part include Tau21,Tau32,C2b1, and MannWhitney U test
<ul>
<li>Histograms
<ul>
<li>All histograms include underflow and overflow numbers in the bin 1 and the last bin.</li>
<li>After selecting with Prof.Ashutosh, we choose <strong>0.5 GeV CUT</strong>(exclude cluster and 0.25GeV) for summary, both for ROC curves and MannWhitney U test.</li>
<li>In the FIGs, inclunding the histograms of signal and background, and MannWhitney value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Analysis
<ol>
<li>There are many steps as following
<ol>
<li>By the paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FJHEP06%282018%29093.pdf">The recursive soft drop</a> from Professor Jesse Thaler from MIT.<br />
We are suggested by Professor Jesse Thaler to cut the mass. Becasue we found that beta=0 case is better to distinguish signal from background than beta=2 one , we choose beta=0 soft drop mass to cut at signal 50%, so the first step, we cut at there. I will talk about the detail of analysis in the <font color="red">NOTE1</font>.</li>
<li>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyman%E2%80%93Pearson_lemma">Neymanâ€“Pearson lemma
</a>, it told us that using the ratio bin content <strong>[SIG/BKG]</strong> to select the width, it can give us the best ROC curve performance. So the second step, we draw the ratio histogram, and we use the highest ratio bin as the first bin (Starting bin,Seed bin) and draw the ROC curves.</li>
<li>Then, we compare left and right ratio bin content of the highest ratio bin content, adding the higher side bin to be the our next width, and keep comparing left and right ratio bin content until looping all the bins. For example:
<ol>
<li>[ath,bth] means [ath bin to bth bin]&rarr;[14th,16th] means 14th,15th,16th.
<li>if the 15th bin has the highest ratio bin content, we will compare 14th and 16th, if 14th is higher than 16th, we add 14th to be the next width, so our next width is [14th,15th].</li>
<li>Next, because our new width is [14th,15th], we need to compare the ratio bin content about 13th and 16th, if 16th is higher than 13th, we will add the width to [14th,16th], and so on.</li>
<li>There have some special cases when we do and compare the ratio histogram bin, I will talk some <strong>special conditions and our settings</strong> in <font color="red">NOTE2</font>
.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<li>For MannWhitney test, when the MannWhitney number close to zero, it means the distinguish power is better.</li>
</ul>

For summary: 
* There are <strong>NO IMPROVEMENT</strong> for all variables with the smallest detector cell size. For some variables, the biggest detector cell size is the best. This is an inetresting condition.<br />

<font color="red">NOTE1</font>:
Detail about the analysis for mass_cut method (Histograms are from soft drop mass with beta=0)</font>
<ol>
<li>First, we will find the highest signal bin in the signal histogram.</li>
<li>Next, we will compare the left and the right bin content of the highest signal bin, and add the higher side bin as the width.</li>
<li>If left and right side of the bin content are same, we will randomly choose one.
<li>Until we find one width that includes more than 50% signal, we stop at there, and give out the Tau and C variables.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<font color="red">NOTE2</font>: Detail about the analysis for Tau and C variables (A little bit complicated)
<br />
<ul>
<li>In the default ratio bin content, we use <strong>[SIG/BKG]</strong> "Divide" in root [bin by bin], but we found that when SIG bin content!=0 and BKG bin content=0, that bin's ratio bin content is zero in default. But in the math, if !=0/=0, it will be an extreme value, so we set an extreme value manually when [SIG bin content!=0 and BKG bin content=0] happen, we set this ratio bin content as 9999. All other ratio bin contents are same as default.</li>
<br />
<li>When we compare left and right ratio bin content, in some conditions, we could bump into the ratio bin content is zero in the certain side (or both sides), and we set other value to represent this ratio bin content. In general, we use the signal and background bins left ( when this bin is left ) or right ( when this bin is right ) this ratio bin content, and do some calculations as following:
<ul>
<li>Suppose that our width now is [14th,15th], and compare 13th with 16th.</li>
<li>If the left ratio bin content is 0 (13th bin) in default, we will see two things : Integral.[Minimum bin number=1th in our study, 12th] of SIG and BKG, and using the setting value to represent this ratio bin content.
<ol>
<li>If SIG.Integral[1th,12th] = 0 , BKG.Integral[1th,12th]= 0 &rarr; The ratio bin content is set to -1 [13th ratio bin content=-1], and let it add other side until both side bins are no signal and background.</li> 
<li>If SIG.Integral[1th,12th] != 0 , BKG.Integral[1th,12th]= 0 &rarr; The ratio bin content is set to 9999[13th ratio bin content=9999], and let it add this side until this side have no signal.</li> 
<li>If SIG.Integral[1th,12th] = 0 , BKG.Integral[1th,12th] != 0 &rarr; Just similar to the ratio histogram formula, SIG.Integral[1th,12th] /BKG.Integral[1th,12th] =0[13th ratio bin content=0]</li> 
<li>If SIG.Integral[1th,12th] != 0 , BKG.Integral[1th,12th] != 0 &rarr; Just similar to the ratio histogram formula, SIG.Integral[1th,12th]/BKG.Integral[1th,12th] =the value it has[13th ratio bin content=the value it has]</li> 
</ol>
<li>If the right ratio bin content is zero (16th bin) in default, we see two things : [17th,Maximum bin number=25th in our study] SIG and BKG, and using the setting value to represent this ratio bin content.
<ol>
<li>If SIG.Integral[17th,25th] = 0 , BKG.Integral[17th,25th] = 0 &rarr; We set the ratio bin content as -1[16th ratio bin content=-1], and let it continually add other side until both side are no signal and background.</li> 
<li>If SIG.Integral[17th,25th] != 0 , BKG.Integral[17th,25th] = 0 &rarr; We will set the ratio bin content as 9999[16th ratio bin content=9999], and let it continually add this side until this side have no signal.</li> 
<li>If SIG.Integral[17th,25th] = 0 , BKG.Integral[17th,25th] != 0 &rarr; Just like the ratio bin content formula, SIG.Integral[17th,25th]/BKG.Integral[17th,25th]=0[16th ratio bin content=0]</li> 
<li>If SIG.Integral[17th,25th] != 0 , BKG.Integral[17th,25th] != 0 &rarr; Just like the ratio bin content formula, SIG.Integral[17th,25th]/BKG.Integral[17th,25th]=the value it has[16th ratio bin content=the value it has]</li> 
</ol>
<li>Every time we bump into the condition that ratio bin content is zero, we will use the same concept to choose.</li>
</ul>
<li>Comparing all the bins, we can fninish drawing the ROC curves.</li>
</li>
</li>
</ul>
